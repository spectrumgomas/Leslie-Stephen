# I Introduction #
Were what we have done for others the measure of what should be done for us, then the life of Leslie Stephen, if written at all, should be well written. Moreover, I think that had he been an impartial judge in his own cause, he would have admitted that an interesting book might be made about him. His insight, his honesty, his sympathy, his humour were sometimes expended with good results upon tasks that were far less promising, and before I have done what I have to do, I shall hear him allowing that my materials were better than he thought, though he would not commend the unskilful use that will be made of them.
In two or three words I will explain why I turn my hand to work od a kind to which it is not accustomed, and then I will say no more of myself. I first met Leslie Stephen on Sunday, April 4, 1880. He was then forty-seven years old and I was nearly thirty. A friend of ours had enlisted me as one of those `Sunday Tramps` of whom a word must be said hereafter.
